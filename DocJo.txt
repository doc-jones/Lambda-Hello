Hello! My name is Debi Jones, but my friends call me Doc.

    I'm extroverted, creative and sarcastic, except when I'm not. Just kidding. I'm always introverted.

    Some of my day is spent away from flailing on Lambda School concepts and challenges. Hard to imagine, I know. In those times, my murder dog, Josie, and I play to keep her responses sharp, just in case. Dogs are excellent tools of self-defense. They instinctively warn in body language and verbal cues when ever something happens. They warn when anything happens. For example, when a cat walks across the yard, or when a dog 2 miles away barks a greeting. These are important data points, if one is a dog. Those events are less valued by human creatures. Silly humans. Anyway, they also can provide a barrier to uninvited human guests if they are scary enough like my murder dog. We spend time together to bond and play. It's important that one's murder dog likes them; making the likelihood that she will protect me versus attack me greater. Her bark is sharp and loud. This a desirable trait, because it scares humans, especially the uninvited ones. We share a mutually beneficial relationship. She will murder anyone who threatens me, and in return, I feed and play with her. Having your own murder dog is a greatly satisfying and rewarding endeavor. I recommend it highly.  I'll never regret bring home and spending time with my murder dog, Josie. She's a Chihuahua.
