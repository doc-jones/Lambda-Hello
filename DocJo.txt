Hello! My name is Debi Jones, but my friends call me Doc.

    I'm extroverted, fashion-forward and Insta fabulous!
    
    Some of my day is spent away from flailing on Lambda School concepts and challenges. Hard to imagine, I know. In those times, I'm shopping, partying and hanging with the cool kids.  Which parties you ask? All of the parties!
